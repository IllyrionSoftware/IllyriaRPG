# This configuration file provides some general configuration.
# Worlds and their regeneration behaviour can be configured in the worlds.yml file.

general:
  # Default: English (en-US) - no download required.
  # You can access translations maintained by the community in our Discord: https://discord.gg/B4MAJVk
  # To access translations, other than en-US, execute /translations in the Discord server.
  # The translation name should match the official language code (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html).
  # This option also affects the grouping and decimal separator for currency formatting.
  language: "en-US"

# NOTE: Changes to this section require server reload / restart.
# The queue regenerates x chunks (defined by option "max") every interval (defined by option "interval_time").
queue:
  # Should it only regenerate chunks that are already loaded?
  # Disabling that option is not recommended. Regenerating chunks that are loaded puts a lot less stress on your server.
  # If a chunk is expired and is unloaded, while this option is enabled, it will simply regenerate once it gets loaded again
  # for whatever reason.
  only-loaded: true
  # Set the interval of the regeneration queue.
  interval_time: 2s
  # Set the maximum amount of regenerations per cycle.
  max: 1

database:
  # MySQL database
  # To use this without issues, your connection limits etc. need to be configured properly in your MySQL server configuration.
  # It is not recommended connecting multiple instances of WildRegeneration to one database with the same table prefix.
  mysql:
    # NOTE: If disabled, SQLite will be used instead.

    ip-address: "localhost"
    port: "3306"
