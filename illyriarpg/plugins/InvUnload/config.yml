#####   InvUnload   #####
#########################

#
# InvUnload has the following commands:
#
# /unload will check if nearby chests contain items you are carrying
# outside of your hotbar. If yes, those will be put into the chest.
#
# /dump will dump all your inventory contents except your hotbar into
# nearby chests, regardless of what is inside, but it first try
# to /unload them.
#
# /unloadinfo (or /dumpinfo) will show you in which chests your stuff
# went into when you last used /unload or /dump.
#
# Players need the invunload.use permission for all regular commands.
#
# If you have the permission invunload.reload, you can reload the
# config using /unload reload
#

# do /unload or /dump.
